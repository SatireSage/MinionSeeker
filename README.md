2. Tap on a cell to investigate it. If it contains a minion, the minion will be revealed. If not, a scan will be triggered, displaying the count of hidden minions in the same row and column as the selected cell.
3. Use the scan information to make strategic decisions on which cells to inspect.
4. The game ends when all minions are found. A congratulations dialog will be displayed, and you will be redirected to the main menu.
